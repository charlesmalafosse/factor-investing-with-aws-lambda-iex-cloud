# Update Paramaters with your own

 * S3_BUCKET_NAME: Change the S3 bucket. S3 bucket names have to be unique. So make sure you find a name not used by someone else.
 * PUBLISHABLE: Change the IEX Cloud API token (the publishable token that you can find here: https://iexcloud.io/console/tokens)   
 * ENVIRONMENT: Change the env type, use "production" to run it normally or any other type such as "staging" to only download and compute with 100 stocks. This has the benefit or reducing the cost.
